# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key architectural decisions for ComponentForge.

## ADRs

- [0001: BFF Pattern](./0001-bff-pattern.md)

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- Understand why decisions were made
- Evaluate trade-offs that were considered
- Track the evolution of architecture over time
- Onboard new team members effectively

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title**: Brief description of the decision
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
3. **Context**: What is the issue we're facing?
4. **Decision**: What decision did we make?
5. **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs and implications?

## Adding a New ADR

1. Create a new file: `NNNN-title-in-kebab-case.md`
2. Use the next available number (NNNN)
3. Follow the ADR format template
4. Add link to this README
5. Submit as part of your PR
