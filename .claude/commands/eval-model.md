Evaluate the AI model with $ARGUMENTS (dataset path):

1. Load test dataset from specified path
2. Run model inference on test samples
3. Calculate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
4. Generate confusion matrix and ROC curves
5. Compare against baseline performance
6. Create evaluation report with visualizations
7. Save results to evaluation_report.md

Output performance metrics and suggest improvements.
