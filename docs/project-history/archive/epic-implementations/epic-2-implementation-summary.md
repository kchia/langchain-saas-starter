# Epic 2: Frontend Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the Epic 2 Frontend Integration Strategy as outlined in `.claude/epic-2-frontend-integration-strategy.md`. This implementation connects the Epic 2 backend (component classification and requirement proposal) to the frontend workflow.

## Implementation Details

### Commit 1: File Persistence (`c03240e`)
**Goal**: Store screenshot file in workflow store for requirements page access

**Changes**:
- `app/src/stores/useWorkflowStore.ts`:
  - Added `uploadedFile: File | null` state
  - Added `setUploadedFile(file: File)` action
  - Updated `resetWorkflow()` to clear uploadedFile

- `app/src/app/extract/page.tsx`:
  - Imported `useWorkflowStore`
  - Called `setUploadedFile(selectedFile)` in `handleUpload()` before extraction
  - File now persists across SPA navigation

**Test Verification**:
1. Upload screenshot on `/extract`
2. Navigate to `/requirements`
3. File should be accessible via `useWorkflowStore.uploadedFile`

---

### Commit 2: Requirements Integration (`3208c14`)
**Goal**: Replace placeholder requirements page with Epic 2 integration

**Changes**:
- `app/src/app/requirements/page.tsx`:
  - Complete rewrite from placeholder to production implementation
  - Imported `ApprovalPanelContainer`, `useRequirementProposal`
  - Auto-triggers `proposeRequirements()` on mount if `uploadedFile` exists
  - Shows loading state during 10-15s AI analysis
  - Displays error states for missing file or API failures
  - Renders `ApprovalPanelContainer` with real proposals after analysis

**User Flow**:
1. User navigates from `/extract` → `/requirements`
2. If no file → Shows warning with "Back to Extraction" link
3. If file exists → Auto-triggers AI analysis
4. Loading spinner + "Analyzing your component..." (10-15s)
5. On success → Shows ApprovalPanel with:
   - Component type detection + confidence
   - Props, Events, States, Accessibility proposals
   - Accept/Edit/Remove actions per requirement

**Error Handling**:
- Missing file: Alert with redirect to extract page
- API failure: Error message with "Try Again" button
- Backend unavailable: Graceful error display

---

### Commit 3: Export Flow (`f733d04`)
**Goal**: Add export preview and confirmation before navigating to patterns

**Changes**:
- `app/src/app/requirements/page.tsx`:
  - Added export preview state management
  - Imported `ExportPreview` component and `exportRequirements` API
  - Added `handleShowExportPreview()` - calls `getExportPreview()` API
  - Added `handleExport()` - calls `exportRequirements()` API
  - Conditional navigation button:
    - Before export: "Export Requirements" button
    - After export: "Continue to Patterns" with `?exportId=xxx`

**User Flow**:
1. User reviews/approves requirements
2. Clicks "Export Requirements"
3. Preview modal shows statistics:
   - Total proposed vs approved
   - Approval rate
   - Edit rate
   - Breakdown by category
4. User clicks "Export & Continue"
5. Export ID stored in workflow store
6. "Continue to Patterns" button enabled
7. Navigate to `/patterns?exportId=xxx`

**Export Preview Features**:
- Component type + confidence badge
- Approval statistics (total, approved, rate)
- Edit statistics (edited count, edit rate)
- Category breakdown (Props, Events, States, A11y)
- Metrics validation (approval rate ≥80%, edit rate <30%)

### Commit 4: E2E Tests (`4c0536f`)
**Goal**: Comprehensive Playwright tests with screenshots

**Changes**:
- `app/e2e/requirements-flow.spec.ts`:
  - 3 test scenarios covering the full workflow
  - Screenshots at each step for visual verification
  - Error state testing

**Test Cases**:

1. **Full Requirements Workflow** (main test):
   - Step 1: Extract tokens from screenshot
   - Step 2: Navigate to requirements page
   - Step 3: Verify AI proposal auto-trigger
   - Step 4: Verify ApprovalPanel renders
   - Step 5: Test export flow
   - Step 6: Verify navigation to patterns
   
   Screenshots generated:
   - `requirements-flow-01-extraction.png`
   - `requirements-flow-02-analyzing.png`
   - `requirements-flow-03-proposals.png`
   - `requirements-flow-04-export-preview.png`
   - `requirements-flow-05-exported.png`
   - `requirements-flow-06-final.png`

2. **Missing File Error**:
   - Navigate directly to `/requirements` without upload
   - Verify warning message appears
   - Screenshot: `requirements-flow-error-no-file.png`

3. **Analysis Failure Retry**:
   - Upload screenshot and navigate
   - If analysis fails, verify retry button
   - Screenshot: `requirements-flow-error-analysis.png`

**Running Tests**:
```bash
cd app

# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run in UI mode (recommended)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run with visible browser
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run specific test
npx playwright test requirements-flow.spec.ts
```

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **File Persistence**:
   - [ ] Upload screenshot on `/extract`
   - [ ] Navigate to `/requirements`
   - [ ] Verify no error about missing file
   - [ ] Check browser DevTools → Zustand store has `uploadedFile`

2. **Requirements Integration**:
   - [ ] Start from `/extract`, upload screenshot
   - [ ] Click "Continue to Requirements"
   - [ ] See "Analyzing your component..." message
   - [ ] Wait 10-15 seconds
   - [ ] Verify ApprovalPanel appears
   - [ ] Check component type badge (e.g., "Button")
   - [ ] Verify 4 categories: Props, Events, States, Accessibility
   - [ ] Try accept/edit/remove actions

3. **Export Flow**:
   - [ ] Approve some requirements
   - [ ] Click "Export Requirements"
   - [ ] See export preview modal
   - [ ] Check statistics are accurate
   - [ ] Click "Export & Continue"
   - [ ] Verify "Continue to Patterns" appears
   - [ ] Click it and verify URL has `?exportId=xxx`

4. **Error States**:
   - [ ] Navigate to `/requirements` directly → See warning
   - [ ] Stop backend → Try requirement proposal → See error
   - [ ] Click "Try Again" → Should retry

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Run E2E tests
cd app
npm run test:e2e

# View test report
npx playwright show-report

# Screenshots will be in test-results/
```

## Known Limitations

1. **File Persistence Across Refreshes**:
   - File objects are not serializable
   - If user refreshes `/requirements`, file is lost
   - **Solution**: Redirect to `/extract` with warning message
   - **Future**: Store uploaded file in backend

2. **Backend Dependency**:
   - Frontend requires backend to be running
   - **Solution**: Clear error messages with retry option
   - Tests handle backend unavailability gracefully

3. **AI Latency**:
   - Target: p50 ≤15s
   - Can vary based on image complexity and API load
   - **Solution**: Clear loading indicators and progress feedback

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Manual testing by stakeholders
2. Review test screenshots in PR
3. Verify LangSmith traces are visible
4. Check approval/edit rate metrics

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
1. **Epic 3**: Use `exportId` in patterns page to retrieve requirements
2. **Epic 4**: Pass requirements to code generation
3. **Epic 5**: Validate generated code against requirements
4. **Performance**: Optimize proposal latency to <10s p50
5. **Persistence**: Store uploaded files in backend/database
