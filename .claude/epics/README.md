## Epic Overview

### 🎯 P0 - Critical for Demo Day

#### [Epic 001: RAGAS Evaluation Framework](./epic-001-evaluation-framework.md)
**Duration:** 3-5 days | **Priority:** P0

**Problem:** No quantified proof of AI performance. Demo day judges need numbers, not vibes.

**Solution:**
- Implement RAGAS framework for token extraction accuracy (target: >90%)
- Generate 100+ synthetic test dataset with ground truth
- Build evaluation dashboard at `/evaluation`
- Add CI/CD pipeline that fails on accuracy regression

**Demo Day Impact:**
*Before:* "Our multi-agent system works well."
*After:* "ComponentForge achieves 94% token extraction accuracy—7% better than humans—and generates production-ready components in 12 seconds."

**Key Deliverables:**
- `backend/src/evaluation/` - Metrics, evaluator, dataset
- Evaluation dashboard showing precision, recall, F1 scores
- Automated testing in CI/CD
- Quantified metrics ready for deck

**References:** Bootcamp Week 4, Veritin AI (12% improvement), OnCall Lens (437% improvement)

#### [Epic 002: Business Metrics & Validation](./epic-002-business-validation.md)
**Duration:** 2-3 days | **Priority:** P0

**Problem:** Technical excellence without business validation. Need House Whisperer-style metrics (13:1 LTV/CAC).

**Solution:**
- Time study: Manual vs ComponentForge (target: 90-150 min saved)
- Accuracy study: Human vs AI token extraction
- 5 user testimonials with quantified ROI
- Market sizing: TAM ($49B) / SAM ($15B) / SOM ($25M)
- Interactive ROI calculator at `/roi-calculator`

**Demo Day Impact:**
*Before:* "Designers and developers love ComponentForge."
*After:* "ComponentForge saves teams $429K per year by converting components 90% faster. We've generated 247 components for 5 pilot customers, saving 520 developer hours."

**Key Deliverables:**
- `.claude/research/` - Time study, accuracy study results
- `.claude/testimonials/` - 5 case studies with metrics
- ROI calculator showing payback period
- Market analysis with cited sources

### 🛡️ P1 - Required for Production

#### [Epic 003: Safety & Guardrails](./epic-003-safety-guardrails.md)
**Duration:** 2-3 days | **Priority:** P1

**Problem:** Generated code and uploaded images create attack vectors. OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities unaddressed.

**Solution:**
- Input validation: File type, size, EXIF, malware scanning
- PII detection: OCR + Presidio to flag sensitive data
- Code sanitization: Block eval(), dangerouslySetInnerHTML, XSS
- Rate limiting: Tiered limits (free/pro/enterprise)
- Prompt injection protection: Detect and block manipulation
- Security monitoring: Dashboard at `/admin/security`

**Production Readiness:**
- Zero critical vulnerabilities in security audit
- 100% of inputs validated before processing
- Real-time alerting on security events

**Key Deliverables:**
- `backend/src/security/` - Input validator, PII detector, code sanitizer
- Security metrics tracked in Prometheus
- Admin dashboard for security monitoring

**References:** Bootcamp Week 8, OWASP Top 10 2023, LangChain security best practices

---

#### [Epic 004: LangSmith Monitoring & Observability](./epic-004-observability.md)
**Duration:** 2-3 days | **Priority:** P1

**Problem:** LangSmith mentioned but not comprehensively integrated. Can't debug, optimize, or prove AI quality.

**Solution:**
- Full LangSmith tracing: 100% coverage of AI operations
- Multi-agent workflow visualization: See all 7 agents in trace hierarchy
- Prompt engineering: A/B test 3+ variants per agent
- Cost tracking: Budget alerts for $100/day, $2K/month
- Error tracking: Sentry integration linked to LangSmith traces
- Performance dashboard: Real-time metrics at `/admin/monitoring`

**Demo Day Impact:**
Show live LangSmith trace during demo:
"Here's a real component generation—12.3 seconds, 72K tokens, $0.42 cost. We optimized the Token Extractor and reduced latency 40%."

**Key Deliverables:**
- `backend/src/monitoring/` - Cost tracker, A/B testing, metrics
- Performance dashboard with latency heatmaps
- LangSmith projects for dev/staging/prod
- Prompt version control with A/B testing

**References:** Bootcamp Week 2, LangSmith documentation

### 🚀 P2 - Innovation & Differentiation

#### [Epic 005: Advanced Integrations (MCP & Design Tools)](./epic-005-advanced-integrations.md)
**Duration:** 3-4 days | **Priority:** P2

**Problem:** Screenshot-only workflow creates friction. Modern design tools need direct integration.

**Solution:**
- MCP Server: Figma integration via Model Context Protocol
- Figma Plugin: One-click "Generate Code" without screenshots
- VS Code Extension: Cmd+Shift+G to generate from clipboard
- Sketch Integration: Support non-Figma users
- Penpot Integration: Open-source ecosystem support
- Bidirectional Sync: Push implementation status back to Figma

**Market Differentiation:**
- First design-to-code tool using MCP (cutting-edge)
- Bidirectional sync is unique feature
- Multi-tool support (Figma, Sketch, Penpot)
- Open-source friendly

**Key Deliverables:**
- `backend/src/mcp/` - MCP server for Figma
- `figma-plugin/` - Published to Figma Community
- `vscode-extension/` - Published to VS Code Marketplace
- `sketch-plugin/` - Available for download

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| RAGAS metrics don't align with design-to-code task | High | Define custom metrics specific to token extraction | AI Engineer |
| Synthetic dataset not representative | Medium | Mix synthetic + real user screenshots | QA |
| MCP integration complexity | Medium | Start with Figma only, expand later | Backend |
| Security vulnerabilities in generated code | High | Multi-layer sanitization + manual review | Security |

### Timeline Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Evaluation takes longer than 3 days | Medium | Start with subset of metrics, expand post-demo |
| User testimonials delayed | Low | Use 3 testimonials minimum vs 5 ideal |
| MCP integration blocked | Low | Epic 005 is P2—can defer if needed |
