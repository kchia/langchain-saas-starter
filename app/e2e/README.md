## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   ```

2. **For onboarding tests only:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e e2e/onboarding.spec.ts
   ```

3. **For full integration tests:**
   - Start backend and services: `make dev`
   - Add test fixtures (see `fixtures/README.md`)
   - Set environment variables in `.env.test`

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run in UI mode (recommended for debugging)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run with visible browser
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run in debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test e2e/onboarding.spec.ts

# Run specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
```

### CI Mode

Tests automatically run in CI with:
- Headless mode
- Retry on failure (2 retries)
- HTML reporter
- Trace collection on failure

## Test Configuration

See `playwright.config.ts` for:
- Browser configuration (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Base URL configuration
- Timeout settings
- Reporter configuration
- Web server auto-start

## Environment Variables

Create `.env.test` in the `app` directory:

```bash
# Frontend URL
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Backend URL
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Figma test credentials (for Figma integration tests)
TEST_FIGMA_PAT=your-figma-personal-access-token
TEST_FIGMA_URL=https://www.figma.com/file/your-file-key/your-file-name
```

## Test Data

Add test fixtures to `fixtures/` directory:
- `design-system-sample.png` - Screenshot of a design system
- See `fixtures/README.md` for details

## Enabling Skipped Tests

Many tests in `token-extraction.spec.ts` are marked with `.skip()` because they require:
1. Running backend with all services
2. Test fixture files
3. Environment variables

To enable a test:
1. Remove `.skip()` from the test
2. Ensure prerequisites are met
3. Update selectors if UI has changed

Example:
```typescript
// Before
test.skip('TASK 12.4: edit colors and verify updates persist', async ({ page }) => {
  // test code
});

// After
test('TASK 12.4: edit colors and verify updates persist', async ({ page }) => {
  // test code
});
```

## Debugging Tests

### UI Mode (Recommended)
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```
This opens an interactive UI where you can:
- See test execution in real-time
- Inspect each step
- Debug failed tests
- Re-run specific tests

### Debug Mode
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```
Opens Playwright Inspector for step-by-step debugging.

### Screenshots and Videos

Playwright automatically:
- Takes screenshots on failure
- Records traces for retried tests
- Saves artifacts to `test-results/`

### View Test Report

After running tests:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tests fail to start
- Ensure frontend dev server is running: `npm run dev`
- Or let Playwright start it automatically (configured in `playwright.config.ts`)

### "Page didn't load" errors
- Check that `http://localhost:3000` is accessible
- Verify no other process is using port 3000

### Selector not found
- UI may have changed - update selectors in test file
- Use Playwright Inspector to find correct selectors: `npm run test:e2e:debug`

### Timeout errors
- Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`
- Or in specific test: `test.setTimeout(60000)`

## Best Practices

1. **Use data-testid attributes** for stable selectors
2. **Keep tests independent** - each test should work in isolation
3. **Clean up state** - use `beforeEach` to reset localStorage, cookies, etc.
4. **Use page object pattern** for complex UIs
5. **Mock external APIs** when possible to reduce flakiness

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow existing test structure and naming
2. Add clear descriptions and comments
3. Mark tests with `.skip()` if they require backend
4. Update this README with new test coverage
5. Ensure tests pass locally before committing
