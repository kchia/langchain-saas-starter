# AI Development Best Practices Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive best practices for developing AI applications, with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

## Core Principles

### 1. Data Quality and Preparation

**Clean Data is Essential**
- Ensure your training and knowledge base data is high-quality, accurate, and relevant
- Remove duplicates, outdated information, and biased content
- Implement proper data validation and sanitization pipelines

**Document Structure**
- Use consistent formatting and structure across documents
- Include proper metadata (title, author, date, categories)
- Chunk documents appropriately for vector search

### 2. Model Selection and Configuration

**Choose the Right Model**
- GPT-4: Best for complex reasoning and creative tasks
- GPT-3.5-turbo: Good balance of cost and performance
- Claude: Excellent for analysis and safety-conscious applications
- Local models: Consider for privacy-sensitive applications

**Configuration Guidelines**
- Temperature: 0.1-0.3 for factual tasks, 0.7-0.9 for creative tasks
- Max tokens: Set based on expected output length
- Top-p: Generally 0.9-1.0 for most applications

### 3. Prompt Engineering

**Structure Your Prompts**
```
System: [Role and context]
Human: [Clear, specific instruction]
Examples: [Few-shot examples if needed]
Output format: [Specify desired format]
```

**Best Practices**
- Be specific and clear in your instructions
- Provide context and examples
- Use consistent formatting
- Test prompts thoroughly before deployment

### 4. RAG Implementation

**Vector Database Selection**
- Qdrant: High performance, good for production
- Pinecone: Managed service, easy to scale
- Weaviate: Open source with semantic search
- ChromaDB: Simple, good for prototyping

**Embedding Models**
- text-embedding-3-small: Cost-effective for most use cases
- text-embedding-3-large: Higher quality, more expensive
- all-MiniLM-L6-v2: Good open-source alternative

**Retrieval Strategies**
- Semantic similarity: Standard vector search
- Hybrid search: Combine vector and keyword search
- Re-ranking: Use secondary models to improve relevance
- Metadata filtering: Filter by document properties

### 5. Security and Safety

**Input Validation**
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting
- Use content filtering for harmful content
- Validate file uploads carefully

**Output Filtering**
- Check for sensitive information in responses
- Implement toxicity detection
- Use moderation APIs when available
- Log and monitor for abuse

### 6. Performance Optimization

**Caching Strategies**
- Cache embeddings and frequently accessed data
- Use Redis for session data and temporary results
- Implement proper cache invalidation
- Consider CDN for static assets

**Async Processing**
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Queue long-running tasks
- Stream responses when possible

### 7. Monitoring and Evaluation

**Key Metrics**
- Response time and latency
- Token usage and costs
- User satisfaction ratings
- Error rates and types

**Evaluation Methods**
- RAGAS for RAG system evaluation
- Human evaluation for quality assessment
- A/B testing for feature comparison
- Automated testing for regression detection

## Implementation Checklist

### Development Phase
- [ ] Set up proper development environment
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Document API endpoints and usage
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Pre-Production
- [ ] Conduct security audit
- [ ] Perform load testing
- [ ] Validate data privacy compliance
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create runbooks for operations

### Production
- [ ] Monitor system performance
- [ ] Track user feedback
- [ ] Regular model evaluation
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Plan for model updates

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Insufficient Context**: Not providing enough context in prompts
2. **Poor Chunking**: Incorrect document chunking strategy
3. **Embedding Mismatch**: Using different models for indexing and retrieval
4. **No Fallbacks**: Not handling API failures gracefully
5. **Inadequate Testing**: Insufficient testing of edge cases
